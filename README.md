Draft Pick Order Calculator (Post-Playoffs) (Helps you assign rookie draft pick order fairly based on playoff results, which Sleeper doesn’t automate well for custom leagues.)

Team Analyzer & Positional Need Report (Tell a manager: “You’re weak at WR and overloaded at TE. Here's your positional value breakdown.”)

Trade Block Analyzer + Smart Proposal Generator (Let a user scan the Sleeper trade block, find mismatches, and propose fair trades based on dynasty value.)

Value Riser Alerts (Weekly report: “These 5 players gained most value this week”)

Trade Simulator (Manually plug in any 2 sides and get value/impact analysis)

Aging Out Report (Show which players on your team may decline soon (age 28+ RBs, 30+ WRs))
